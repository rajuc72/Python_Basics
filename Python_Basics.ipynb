        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "- Python is an object oriented, high-level programming language, now adays python language became very popular because of its features which made most of AI tools to integrate and run the code anywhere. It has versatile and powerful libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib,etc which are widely used in the AI industry.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "- Interpreter means it runs the code/executes the code line b line. While writing the python code , we can easily findout the erros, the interpreter made the Python program as human friendly and easy to understand the execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "- Pre-defined keywords are nothing but reserved words that have a special meaning and funtionality and which cannot be used as variable names or function names. We have 35 eywords in Python like if , elif, break, continue, for while, lambda, def and so on.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "- No we cannot be used keywords as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "- Mutability means it can be modified or changed after created. Like integer , list, float type of variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "- The major difference is lists are initialized in square brackets[] and tuple variable are created using paranthesis (). Because of paranthesis declaration the system denotes that all the contents inside tuple varible as arguments refers to objects. SO that we cannot modify or change till end of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "- == is used to compare two variables like if a==b means if a is equal to b then true block will be executed.\n",
        "While 'is' is an identidity operator. Which is used to find whether 'a' and 'b' variables represents same memory  location or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "- We have three logical operators in python. i.e AND, OR and NOT, which are used in conditional statements.\n",
        "a=150,b=90\n",
        "Example: if ((a>100) AND (b<100))---> return TRUE\n",
        "OR --->Either of them true , the result would be true.\n",
        "NOT---> It returns opposite, if its true, it returns False.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "- Type Casting is nothing but changing its Data type to the desired type.\n",
        "Ex: a=8---> its an integer\n",
        "a=str(a) ---> Now varible 'a' is string type.  \n",
        "We have two (Implicit and explicit) types of type casting.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "- Implicit means system automatically changes its data type into the other without writing the code. Ex: a=5, b=3.5; c=a*b returns float type.\n",
        "Explicit means specifying the type casting explicitely .\n",
        "Ex: a=5. n=float(a)---retruns 5.0\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "- The main purpose of conditional statements are to execute set of staements if the condition is true , else other block of statements should be executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "- Elif statements are writen in the 'If' block.The main 'IF' condition becomes TRUE , elif statements will be checked. We can write n number of Elif statements within the 'IF'. We can write final else block after Elif statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Ex: IF((a>B) and (a>c)):\n",
        "print(\"A is biggest\")\n",
        "elif(b>c) :\n",
        "print(\"B is biggest\")\n",
        "Else:\n",
        "print(\"C is biggest\")\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "- Both are looping menthods, which are used to execute the statements repetedly . For loop is more user friendly , there is no need to specify the increment or decrement explicitely.However in for loop the interable variable increases or decreases its value before it checks the condition. In while, the interpreter first checks the condition, later the iterable variable increses or decreases.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "- While loop is more suiable when we dont know the no. of iterations we need exactly. While loop breaks iteration based on a condition.\n",
